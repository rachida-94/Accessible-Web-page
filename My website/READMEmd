or my website, I started by creating a navigation bar to ensure seamless browsing. After that, I added a small About Us section with an article to introduce the company. In the Services section, I included two icons to visually represent offerings.

One challenge I faced was integrating a CSS grid while keeping my navigation bar well-organized. I wanted a clean layout without disrupting the overall structure. In addition, I incorporated a contact form for user interaction and placed the footer at the bottom to complete the design.

Throughout the development process, I used assistive technology to enhance accessibility and functionality.
