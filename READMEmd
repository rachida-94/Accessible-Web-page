I am creating my first responsive web page. I started with the navigation bar and added a small article to the 'About Us' section, which appears when hovered over. After that, I worked on the heading and included a small paragraph. Then, I incorporated icons into the 'Services' section using CSS Grid for layout. However, I encountered a challengeâ€”Grid affected the navigation bar, and I wanted the icons to appear only on hover. To solve this, I adjusted my approach to achieve the desired effect, resulting in the current design you see on my page. I also added a contact form that includes fields for first name, last name, email, country, and message. At the bottom of the page, I included a footer with social media links. Throughout my coding process, I ensured accessibility by using the label tag and the nav and form tags.

My main resource was W3Schools.
